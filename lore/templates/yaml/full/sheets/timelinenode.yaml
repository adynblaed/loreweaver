  __description__: "Represents a node in a branching timeline, allowing for complex\
    \ narrative progression.\n\nAttributes:\n    event_id (UUID): UUID of the associated\
    \ event.\n    timestamp (datetime): Timestamp for when this node occurs.\n   \
    \ next_nodes (List[UUID]): UUIDs of potential future timeline nodes.\n    previous_nodes\
    \ (List[UUID]): UUIDs of previous timeline nodes.\n    branch_probability (float):\
    \ Likelihood of this branch being followed."
